Q&A:
Q: How long did you spend on this tech test? Did you use any methodologies or techniques when writing the code?
I spent a total of 4 hours on this project. Approximately 2 hours on completing the UI as close to the design and another 2 hours doing the javascript implementation. The implementation consisted of dynamically generating html elements and refactoring code until functionality was achieved.

Methodologies/Techniques considered:
- Flexbox vs Grid layout 
- Pure Javascript/ Jquery
- Es6 

Q:If you had more time to spend on the solution, what else would you add/extend?
I'd like to add the search implementation in the search box and the star rating 
I would also like to try other ways of making the application more scalable i.e. how will it handle adding more listings?

Q:What browsers did you test this in? 
When deployed using github pages 
Default browser - Google chrome 
Also tested in:
- Firefox, Opera and Apple Safari 

Q:Are there any UI/UX improvements you would suggest for the current design?
- Loading times
-Accessibility 
-White spaces 
- User -input/feedback for design
