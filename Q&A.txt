Q&A:
Q: How long did you spend on this tech test? Did you use any methodologies or techniques when writing the code?

I invested a total of 4 hours to this project, dedicating approximately 2 hours to crafting the UI to closely match the design specifications. The remaining 2 hours were devoted to the  implementation of JavaScript functionality. This involved the dynamic generation of HTML elements and multiple rounds of code refactoring.

Methodologies/Techniques considered:
- Flexbox vs Grid layout 
- Pure Javascript/ Jquery
- Es6 

Q: If you had more time to spend on the solution, what else would you add/extend?

If given additional time to enhance the solution, I would also implement the search functionality within the search box and integrating a star rating system to enrich the user experience. Additionally, I'd explore strategies for scalability to ensure the application seamlessly accommodates the addition of more listings.

Furthermore, I would refine the design aesthetics by fine-tuning box shadowing and border radius, aiming for a crisper appearance aligned with the target design. Addressing the alignment of drop-down boxes with cards would be another area of focus to optimise the overall layout and visuals.

Q: What browsers did you test this in? 

First deployed using github pages and then tested on browsers such as:
- Google chrome, Firefox, Opera and Apple Safari 

Q: Are there any UI/UX improvements you would suggest for the current design?

1. **Loading Times:**
   - Optimise asset sizes, such as images, to reduce page load times.

2. **Accessibility:**
   - Ensure all UI elements are keyboard accessible, meeting accessibility standards .
   - Check colour contrast ratios for text and background elements to comply with accessibility guidelines.
   - Include descriptive alt text for images to assist users with screen readers.
   - Test with accessibility tools or conduct a manual accessibility audit to identify and address any issues.

3. **White Spaces:**
   - Carefully manage white spaces to maintain a clean and organised layout.
   - Balance spacing to avoid overcrowding or excessive gaps, contributing to a visually appealing design.

4. **User Input/Feedback for Design:**
   - Provide error messages that are informative and guide users toward resolution.
   - Test improvements across various devices and screen sizes to ensure a consistent experience for all users.
