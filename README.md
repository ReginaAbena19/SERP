# Task
Recreate a simplified version of the new UK Search Web page as an HTML page. 
You’ll need to use CSS to style the page and whatever JavaScript you need to get the functionality working. 
Using pure JavaScript is ideal, although using a framework like Vue or React is also fine. 

You’ll notice some features on the page that could be implemented, e.g. the Sort By drop down box. Don’t worry about implementing the logic for these (unless you want to!), the pure UI is what we’re looking for. However, implementation of the toggle should be done.

We’ve attached an assets folder with some images and fonts for you to use in your implementation, but the rest of the styling is up to your interpretation. Getting as close to the original design is the aim.
